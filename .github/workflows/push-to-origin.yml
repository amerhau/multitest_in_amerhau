# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: push to origin

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"

          # Way 1: using Personal Access Token
          # @see https://cpina.github.io/push-to-another-repository-docs/setup-using-personal-access-token.html#setup-personal-access-token
          # 1.1 Generate Personal Access Token: <external repository>/<Avatar>/Settings/Developer settings/Personal access tokens/Generate new token
          #     Select `No expiration` and Check `✅️ repo    Full control of private repositories`, Generate and then Copy the Token
          # 1.2 Then make the token available to the GitHub Action: <internal repository>/Settings/Secrets/Actions/New repository secret
          #     Name: EXTERNAL_REPOSITORY_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN, Value Paste the Token
          # API_TOKEN_GITHUB: ${{ secrets.EXTERNAL_REPOSITORY_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          # Way 2: using SSH deploy keys
          # @see https://cpina.github.io/push-to-another-repository-docs/setup-using-ssh-deploy-keys.html#setup-ssh-deploy-keys
          # 2.1 Generate an SSH key in terminal (Leave the passphrase empty)
          # 2.2 Add public key in the external repository: <external repository>/Settings/Deploy keys/Add deploy key
          #     Name: DEPLOY_PUBLIC_KEY, Value Paste the public key. Enable "✅️ Allow write access"
          # 2.3 Add private key in the source repository: <external repository>/Settings/Secrets/Actions/New repository secret
          #     Name: DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY, Value Paste the private key.
